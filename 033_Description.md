Url: <https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/>

## Description
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., <font color='red'>0 1 2 4 5 6 7</font> might become <font color='red'>4 5 6 7 0 1 2</font>).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
