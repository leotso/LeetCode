# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Url: <https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/>

## Description
Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

For example,
Given input array nums = <font color='red'>[1,1,2]</font>,

Your function should return length = <font color='red'>2</font>, with the first two elements of nums being <font color='red'>1</font> and <font color='red'>2</font> respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
